# Tartarus - A dynamic control structured game
A game by the simplest meaning is a challenge to the cognitive abilities of an individual aimed at entertaining or refreshing the mental state. With rapid technological advancements, this concept has emerged as an industry with enormous market. Modern day video games do not confine themselves to the leisure vested in hobbies. Businesses and careers run at stake with the on-going trends. The common attention has now shifted to enhancing the gaming experiences of the users and generating profits. These trends have led to less concerns over the trivial problems raised by gaming addiction. To overcome these drawbacks and assert conventional meaning to video games we move on to the proposed conceptual game. Tartarus revolves around the idea of providing dynamicity to the control mechanics. The video game features a preliminary control schema for the users which switches via randomness over a function of time. The various finite machine states are triggered as the game progresses. Successive stages keep recursing over the controls at a lower threshold than former ones providing least possible time for neural activity patterns in the brain to emerge with learning sequences. As a result, the ideology of proficiency in a video game by spending time mastering its structure and mechanics is hampered. The conceptual game proposes to test as well as enhance the visual spatial and cognitive skills and reduce effects of gaming addition on impulsiveness, self-control, executive functioning, and cognitive control.

# Running Tartarus
Run the *main.cpp* file in order to start the game. Enjoy!

# Rules
- Collect all the keys.
- If the rocks hit you, you loose a life.
- If you eat the Orb, you can kill the rocks.
- You have a total of 3 lives before which you need to collect all the keys.
- Watch out for the changing controls.

# Publication
On th basis of the game as a POC, I have also published a solution to anti-addiction gaming in IEEE.
